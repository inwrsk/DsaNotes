Stack memory:
    used to store local variables, function calls, or something like primitive datatype
    fast, limited size
Heap memory:
    used to store objects(dynamic memory allocation)
    slow, bigger
// point to note is the objects or any dynamically created datatypes have their memory in heap memory
// unlike the primitive datatypes created with in the function and wipes out of the stack memory when function completes execution
